# Hi, I'm Thomas Ogolla

**ERP Developer | Data Analyst | Backend Engineer**

I'm a creative and results-driven developer with a strong background in **Actuarial Science**, **Data Analytics**, and **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP)**. I thrive at the intersection of **business intelligence**, **software engineering**, and **problem-solving**, and I'm passionate about building tools that drive efficiency, insight, and growth.

- 🔧 I develop extensions for **Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central**, and build custom dashboards using **Power BI**, **Looker Studio**, and **Python**.
- 🧠 I apply data science methods in projects involving **healthcare**, **insurance**, and **supply chain**, using tools like **SQL**, **Python**, and **R**.
- 🏗️ I’m currently building ERP-inspired apps and intelligent dashboards for SMEs in Africa, focusing on clean design, performance, and practical use.
- 🌍 I love using code to solve real-world problems — from automating reports to designing digital platforms that empower others.
